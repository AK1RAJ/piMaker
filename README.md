# piMaker for mapping the overlaps of siRNAs and piRNAs
test BAM files are located in the BAM folder and the corresponding reference sequences are in the refSeq folder

#set working directory and get the files####
#make a project folder with three subfolders for 1- the BAM files (BAM), 2- the reference sequences (refSeq)
#3- the output (Output)
DIR <- "E:/TidyCode"
BAM <- paste0(DIR,"/BAM")
REF <- paste0(DIR,"/refSeq")
OUT <- paste0(DIR,"/Output")

I have not added the save feature yet!
Save feature now added and siRNA overlaps added.
