# piMaker for mapping the overlaps of siRNAs and piRNAs

#set working directory and get the files####
#make a project folder with three subfolders for 1- the BAM files (BAM), 2- the reference sequences (refSeq)
#3- the output (Output)
DIR <- "E:/TidyCode"
BAM <- paste0(DIR,"/BAM")
REF <- paste0(DIR,"/refSeq")
OUT <- paste0(DIR,"/Output")

Save feature now added and siRNA overlaps added.
